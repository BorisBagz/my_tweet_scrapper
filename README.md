# my_tweet_scrapper

So i made this tweet scrapper one day when i was bored during the coronavirus lockdown; and bc susana asked me to.

to run it we need to have the twintproject installed (it asks for python3)
more info here:

> https://github.com/twintproject/twint

the rest is simple, just define the user you want to query at the beginning of the script and when you run it you give the word you want to look for.

have fun!

> linux only for the moment
